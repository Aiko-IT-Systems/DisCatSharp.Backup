# Upgrade from **10.4.0** to **10.6.0**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We dropped support for .NET 5 in favor of newer features and major improvements in speed and stability.
> We removed previously deprecated fields and methods.
> We fixed a major bug with the gateway connection.
> Previously it wasn't actually applying the `version`, `encoding`, and `compress` fields, causing the gateway to use the default but deprecated version 6.

> [!NOTE]
> This release contains important bug fixes and improvements.
> We recommend you to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

## Why weren't there any releases for a long time?

We've been focusing on rewriting internals and improving the library.
Most of the changes were considered highly experimental and not ready for public use.

Other reasons were the lack of motivation to write changelogs 😅
