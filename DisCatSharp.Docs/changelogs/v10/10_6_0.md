# Upgrade from **10.4.0** to **10.6.0**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We dropped support for .NET 5 in favor of newer features and major improvements in speed and stability.
>
> We removed previously deprecated fields and methods.
>
> We fixed a major bug with the gateway connection: Previously it wasn't actually applying the `version`, `encoding`, and `compress` fields, causing the gateway to use the default but deprecated version 6.

> [!NOTE]
> This release contains important bug fixes and improvements.
> We recommend you to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

## Why weren't there any releases for a long time?

We've been focusing on rewriting internals and improving the library.
Most of the changes were considered highly experimental and not ready for public use.

Other reasons were the lack of motivation to write changelogs üòÖ

## Why does this changelog look so small?

We've been focusing on rewriting internals and improving the library.

Furthermore we might have added new features we haven't tracked on our changelog list, we're gonna add them when we find them again üòÖ

## Key Features

### Sentry Integration

Every developer should at least have heard about [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

They were so kind to provide us with a free business plan, which we're using to track errors in our library from now on.

This means that we can now track errors in our library and fix them before you even notice them.

We're also tracking new fields in API payloads, so we can update our library faster.

To enable this feature and help us to improve our library, you need to set up some things in the [DiscordConfiguration](xref:DisCatSharp.DiscordConfiguration).

```cs
DiscordConfiguration configuration = new()
{
    // other settings
    EnableSentry = true, // To generally enable sentry
    AttachUserInfo = true, // To attach the bot id and username to sentry reports
    DeveloperUserId = 32183902178903721, // Set your discord id here so we can reach out to you if we have questions to a bug. Set null or leave it out to disable this feature.
    FeedbackEmail = "your@email.com", // Set your email here so we can reach out to you if we have questions to a bug.
    ReportMissingFields = true // To let sentry report missing fields in API payloads
};
```

### Update check on startup

We've added a new feature to check for new library versions on startup.

This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled in the [DiscordConfiguration](xref:DisCatSharp.DiscordConfiguration).

You can configure the update check with the following properties:

```cs
DiscordConfiguration configuration = new()
{
    // other settings
    DisableUpdateCheck = true, // To disable the update check on startup
    ShowReleaseNotesInUpdateCheck = false, // To disable the release notes in the update check on startup
    UpdateCheckMode = UpdateCheckMode.GitHub, // To check against GitHub instead of NuGet
    UpdateCheckGitHubToken = "ghp_your_token" // Set this to use a personal accesss token, in case you're getting rate limited or you have access to private extensions
};
```

Every official extension supports this too. You currently can't disable this feature seperatly for extensions.
