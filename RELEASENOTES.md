DisCatSharp Release Notes

    Important fix:
    - Fixed api call spamming for message reactions. We depend on message cache now or return an skeleton message if not found.

    Notable Changes
    - Added methods to update the apps banner
    - Fixed guild member banner and avatar decoration data
    - Extended guild member update event args entity
    - Fixed invite type name (incorrect one is deprecated now)
    - Removed test sku id, since that was wrong
    - Replaced user_id by full user object in message.interaction_metadata
    - Added bulk ban methods
